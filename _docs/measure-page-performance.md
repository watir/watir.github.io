The [Watir-WebDriver-Performance gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/watir-webdriver-performance) aims to provide a set of navigation timing metrics for Watir-WebDriver actions using a [W3C page performance standard](http://w3c-test.org/webperf/specs/NavigationTiming/). This is a perfect solution to capture response time metrics, and it’s very straightforward to do but currently only works in Chrome and IE9l, so there’s no Firefox support.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'watir-webdriver'
require 'watir-webdriver-performance'

b = Watir::Browser.new :chrome

10.times do
  b.goto 'http://watir.com'
  load_secs = b.performance.summary[:response_time]/1000
  puts "Load Time: #{load_secs} seconds."
end
{% endhighlight %}

This produces something like:

{% highlight bash %}
Load Time: 3.701 seconds.
Load Time: 0.694 seconds.
Load Time: 1.874 seconds.
Load Time: 1.721 seconds.
Load Time: 2.096 seconds.
Load Time: 0.823 seconds.
Load Time: 2.362 seconds.
Load Time: 1.008 seconds.
Load Time: 1.761 seconds.
Load Time: 2.066 seconds.
{% endhighlight %}
