Once you have [installed Ruby](../docs/ruby), installing and using Watir is easy.

From the command line, install the gem, which Ruby's way of packaging code:

`gem install watir`

Now you can try it out by opening up an Interactive Ruby (irb) session.

* If you’re using Mac OS X open up Terminal and type irb, then hit enter.
* If you’re using Linux, open up a shell and type irb and hit enter.
* If you’re using Windows, open Interactive Ruby from the Ruby section of your Start Menu.

Now you only need to require the gem to [start using it](../docs../browsers).
`require 'watir'`
