    <p>A warm welcome to several new team members: 
Alan Baird, Orde Hiller, Bob Lubecker, and Rodney Urquhart
<!--more-->
<br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/contributors/alan.png" alt="Alan" /> Alan Baird</p>

<p>Alan has used Watir for most of the past decade and has lead software and hardware 
testing teams for over 15 years. He has been an active member in 
the Watir community for several years now, helping with the 
past two Test Automation Bazaars and participating in 
the rebranding of Watir and the creation of the new website.</p>

<p>Alan has agreed to coordinate public group coding sessions to help developers get 
familiar with the Watir code base.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/contributors/orde.png" alt="Orde" /> Orde Hiller</p>

<p>Orde has been providing quality answers on Stack Overflow for the past several years.
He has agreed to be included on the team as a Stack Overflow Support Sheriff
with the hope that he can contribute to the code when he has the elusive “more time.”
According to Stack Overflow, “he prefers to keep an air of mystery” about himself.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/contributors/bob.png" alt="Orde" /> Bob Lubecker</p>

<p>Bob has been using Watir for the past several years and began active participation in
the community earlier this year in helping with the rebranding of Watir and 
has spent a significant effort in making our new Website more usable.</p>

<p>Bob has agreed to take ownership of and maintain the code for this website, including
responding to issues and merging pull requests (please contribute!) from the community.
<br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/contributors/rodney.jpg" alt="Rodney" /> Rodney Urquhart</p>

<p>In his own words, Rodney says “I’m a software engineer with a passion for testing. I love what I do!” 
Rodney has used Watir for the past several years to create automated test frameworks
for several companies. He has been actively participating in the Watir community
since the Selenium conference in Portland last year, including spearheading the 
creation of the new Watir logo.</p>

<p>Rodney will be joining the team in the role of Project Manager to help organize and
prioritize our efforts in moving the Watir code forward. He’s also looking forward
to joining the ranks as a Watir code monkey by adding features from the framework he’s 
written for <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. 
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>Alan, Orde, Bob, and Rodney welcome to the team!</em></strong></p>

<p>We’re always on the lookout for more assistance from the community. A great place
to start is joining in the conversation in our Watir Slack channel. Search for the
Watir channel in the <a href="https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/">Selenium Team Slack</a>.</p>
