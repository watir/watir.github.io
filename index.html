<p>Watir, pronounced just like 'water,' is an open-source Ruby library for automating your UI tests.
  It uses Selenium to 'drive' a browser to take actions the same way people do. It is simple and flexible
  and allows you to write tests that are easy to read and maintain. .</p>

<p>Watir interacts with a browser the same way people do.
  It navigates to pages, clicks links, fills in forms and presses buttons.
