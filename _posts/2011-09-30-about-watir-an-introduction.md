Nice people from <a href="http://www.thetestingplanet.com/">The Testing Planet</a> have published my article <a href="http://www.thetestingplanet.com/2011/09/about-watir-an-introduction/">About Watir – An Introduction</a>. It is an extract from a <a href="http://watir.com/book/">book I am writing on Watir</a>. More articles about Watir should appear at The Testing Planet soon.
