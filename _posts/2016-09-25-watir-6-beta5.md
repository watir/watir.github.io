Watir 6.0 Beta 5 is now available on rubygems! Watir 6.0 depends on
Selenium 3.0, and it will have its production release once Selenium 3 is 
released. We're continuing to update and simplify the code in the meantime. 
This release allows elements in collections to be relocated when stale, 
adds a new visibility locator, and provides updated error messages when 
unable to locate elements.

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir --pre
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", ">= 6.0.0.beta5"
{% endhighlight %}

# Relocating Elements from Collections

This new feature addresses one of the most common confusions
people have with Watir. Watir now allows things like iterating over a 
collection of elements, even when the DOM changes:

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.links.each do |link|
  link.click
  expect(browser.title).not_to eq '404 Not Found'
  browser.back
end
{% endhighlight %}
***Note*** - the above code is for example only, it is not the recommended
way to verify working links. 

The above code would previously have provided this not-very-helpful
error message:

{% highlight ruby %}
Watir::Exception::UnknownObjectException: unable to locate element, using {:element=>#<Selenium::WebDriver::Element:0x2836d06ee67909a id="0.18715359551127864-1">}
{% endhighlight %}

# Visible Locator

As Single Page Apps become more common, there are often multiple
similar forms that exist on the page at the same time, while only one of
them is visible. For instance, a create object modal and an edit object
modal, or a log in modal and a sign up modal. Rather than needing to 
create multiple page objects if the forms have the same characteristics,
or needing to use index locator to pick which form to use, Watir now 
supports locating based on a visible locator:

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.text_field(name: "username", visible: true)
{% endhighlight %}

If there are multiple forms with the a name attribute of "username", this
locator will return the first one that is visible on the page.

# Error messages
Previously, error messages for when elements were not found only returned
selector information for the most nested element. For instance, if this
iframe was present, but the div inside it was not, this used to be the result:

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.iframe(id: 'one').div(id: 'bar').wait_until_present
# => Watir::Wait::TimeoutError: 'waiting for {:id=>"bar", :tag_name=>"div"} to become present'
{% endhighlight %}

To provide more information on the exact problem, the error will now look
like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.iframe(id: 'one').div(id: 'bar').wait_until_present
# => Watir::Wait::TimeoutError: 'waiting for {:id=>"foo", :tag_name=>"iframe"} --> {:id=>"bar", :tag_name=>"div"} to become present'
{% endhighlight %}

for a complete list of updates.
