Welcome to the Watir Podcast. We didn't have a new episode for you so here is one of my favorites from the past, Episode 30 with Gregg Yows, Zeljko Filipin and Jim Knowlton.

You can listen to this podcast at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/the-watir-podcast/episode30-replay).

I have heard a lot of good opinions about choosing to use or not use test automation tools for exploratory testing. Those are not addressed so much here, but some of the ideas here are gold for anybody interested in trying it.

Please give feedback on this podcast on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/the-watir-podcast/episode30-replay), as well as what you would like to hear about on future Watir Podcasts.

You can subscribe to [The Watir Podcast feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:248873479/sounds.rss).
