I have read <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/blog/Commit_Volume_and_Commit_Highlights">Commit Volume and Commit Highlights</a> blog post from the <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/blog">Ohloh Blog</a>.
<!--more-->

Of course, I have immediately took a look at <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/watir/analyses/latest">Watir Code Analysis</a>.

Some of the highlights:

* Jarmo Pertman contributed the most in the last year.
* Hugh McGowan was pretty busy recently, too.
* Bret Pettichord, Paul Rogers and Jarmo Pertman have contributed the most code in the project life time.

For more details, go to <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/watir/analyses/latest">Watir Code Analysis</a> page.
