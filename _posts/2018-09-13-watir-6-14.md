* Element class and attributes are updated to HTML 5.2 and the latest SVG spec

### New Methods

 a cached driver element assigned to it
*  `Element#attribute_list` provides an `Array` of attributes for the ELement instance
*  `Element#attribute_values` provides a `Hash` of attributes and their values for the ELement instance

### Bug Fixes

* Fix bug preventing collection elements from being cached
