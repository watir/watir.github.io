Let us know if you are [having problems](http://watir.com/help/) 
or if you have a [reprodicible bug](https://github.com/watir/watir/issues)
 
The biggest change is around Firefox support. Firefox 48+ will no longer work
with the old Firefox Driver. Mozilla has required extensions to be signed for
security reasons, and the Selenium extension raised security concerns. 
As such, Watir will now default to using Chrome when the browser type is left 
unspecified.

Mozilla has been developing a replacement for the Firefox Driver. 
The browser code is called 
[Marionette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver), 
and the driver executable
to interact with it is [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
It is attempting to be completely compatible with the new 
[W3C WebDriver standard](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html). 
Since that spec isn't finalized yet, there are several features still not implemented.

By default, the following code will use Marionette, and expect to find geckodriver 
on your system path.

{% highlight ruby %}
Watir::Browser.new :firefox
{% endhighlight %}

The original Firefox Driver may still be used so long as it is with a browser
 older than Firefox 48. Many companies following this route plan to use
 [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/).
The following code will specify to use the legacy Firefox Driver, and if multiple
versions of Firefox are present on the same machine, the location of the browser
to use.

{% highlight ruby %}
caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.firefox(marionette: false)
Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Binary.path = "/path/to/desired/firefox"
Watir::Browser.new desired_capabilities: caps
{% endhighlight %}

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/watir/watir/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for
all of the updates.
