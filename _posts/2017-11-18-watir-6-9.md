### Updates

* `Element#flash` had some browser compatibility issues with white backgrounds that has been fixed
* Firefox updated to the latest W3C supported Alert exceptions which Watir did not previously handle
* When working with multi-select lists, #select and #select_all will now accept an array of multiple options: 
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.select_list(name: "new_user_languages").select(["Danish", "Swedish"])
{% endhighlight %}
* The new `Element#set!` method can now handle multiple inputs. Note that the key combinations
that are available in `Element#set` are still not supported
* Mozilla has also implemented a headless mode for Firefox, and it can now be accessed just like Chrome:
{% highlight ruby %}
Watir::Browser.new :firefox, headless: true
{% endhighlight %} 
* Cookies now now be set by String instead of just by `Time`:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.cookies.add 'foo', 'bar', {expires: (Time.now + 10000).to_s}
{% endhighlight %} 
* The generic `Browser#element` and `Browser#elements` methods can now take advantage of the new class locators:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.element(class: ["a", "!c", "b"])
{% endhighlight %} 
* If an element can not be located, and the page contains IFrames, Watir will append a note to the 
error message to: "Maybe look in an iframe?"
