### Performance!

Similar to the Watir 6.4 release last Summer, this release is solely focused on improving
performance. Thanks to the work done mostly by Justin Ko, our approach to locating
elements has been significantly simplified and optimized.

The changes in this Beta - ([#719](https://github.com/watir/watir/pull/719/files) & 
[#720](https://github.com/watir/watir/pull/720/files)) appear to decrease the number of
wire calls in the element tests of our suite by about 40%, which appears to drop 
local execution time (on Travis) by over 15%. This means that when running on a Remote server
like Sauce Labs, depending on what kinds of element calls dominate your tests, you
could see some impressive performance improvements. 

Please try out the new gem on your test suites. We're interested in finding out about new
unexpected exceptions as a result of this change, but feedback on how much it speeds up your tests.

Thanks!

for the complete history of updates.
