Watir 6.0 Beta 4 is now available on rubygems! Watir 6.0 depends on
Selenium 3.0, and it will have its production release once Selenium 3 is 
released. We're continuing to update and simplify the code in the meantime. 
This release adds two new methods and removes two outdated feature toggles.

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir --pre
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", ">= 6.0.0.beta4"
{% endhighlight %}

# New Methods

**`Element#stale?`** - Returns true if a previously located element is no longer attached to DOM
**`Element#wait_until_stale`** - Waits until an element has gone stale

# Always Locate

The in depth details of the history and reasoning for this change are discussed in this 
[Watirtight Testing post](http://watirtight.com/2016/09/11/always-locate.html).

If you currently override the default settings and use 
**`Watir.always_locate = false`**, know that **`#exist?`** and **`#present?`** will
no longer return false for stale elements. Please update your code to 
use **`#stale?`** and **`#wait_until_stale`** as appropriate.

# Prefer CSS

At one point XPath was considered significantly slower (especially on Windows / IE)
than CSS as a means of locating elements. 
[Recent benchmarks in Windows](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/32-xpath-vs-css),
and our own [Watirspecs on Linux](https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir/builds/159034274)
have shown that this is no longer the case. The **`Watir#prefer_css`** toggle
has been deprecated and all elements that can not be passed directly as 
Selenium locators will be translated to XPath.

If you currently override the default settings and use 
**`Watir.prefer_css = true`**, and have reason to believe that this is 
important for your situation, thanks to Alex's recent work 
[making element location extensible](http://watir.github.io/watir-release/),
you can use the new [watir_css gem](https://github.com/watir/watir_css) to
obtain the same behavior.

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/watir/watir/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for
all of the updates.
