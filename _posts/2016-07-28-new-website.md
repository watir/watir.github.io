Welcome to the new Watir website! Content from [watir.com](http://watir.com) and 
[watirwebdriver.com](http://watirwebdriver.com) has been merged here, and both 
domains will soon be redirected here.
 The Watir Team has recommended moving to the WebDriver (Selenium) backed 
 implementation of Watir for several years now, and it is finally time to stop making a 
 distinction when we refer to this project. The original IE-only implementation
 is being deprecated and should no longer be used for production test suites.
  Going forward, the supported Watir code is powered by Selenium.

Selenium is the future of browser automation, and any project that relies on 
that functionality needs to be taking advantage of it. All of the major 
browser vendors (Mozilla, Google, Microsoft and Apple) now have their own 
webdriver implementations, and are all collaborating on an official 
[w3c specification](http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html).

Also of note, this website is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
The code for generating this site is
[available on github](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io). Feel free to
[suggest code](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io/pulls) or
 [identify issues](https://github.com/watir/watir.github.io/issues).
