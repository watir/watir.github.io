### Answers

<span id="A">**What about watir-webdriver?**</span><br>
    All of the watir-webdriver code has been moved to the watir gem.
    The future of Watir is using the W3C specification for automating
    browsers, and that means basing the active implementation of Watir 
    on Selenium.

<span id="B">**Why are my tests failing because of a chromedriver error?**</span><br>
    Due to the changes Mozilla has made recently, it makes more sense for
    Chrome to be the default browser.
    [Download ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
    and place it somewhere on your PATH. 
    [See here for more information](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver).
<br><br>

<span id="C">**Why are my tests failing because of a geckodriver error?**</span><br>
    Mozilla has updated Firefox to no longer allow the previous implementation
    of Firefox Driver to function. The replacement implementation is 
    geckodriver. [Download geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
    and place it somewhere on your PATH. 
    [See here for more information](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/blob/master/README.md).

<span id="D">**Why are my Internet Explorer tests failing?**</span><br>
    Watir now relies on the Selenium driver for Internet Explorer. If 
    you are having issues updating your tests to get them to pass, please 
    [ask us for help](http://watir.github.io/help/)
<br><br>

<span id="E">**Why am I getting warnings about #always_locate and/or #prefer_css?**</span><br>
    Based on recent changes, neither of these options added significant 
    additional functionality so they have been removed. 
    Read [this post](http://watir.github.io/watir-6-beta4/) for more information.

<span id="F">**Why am I getting warnings about #when_present being deprecated?**</span><br>
    Watir by default now automatically calls `#when_present` and
    `#when_enabled` before taking actions on elements where appropriate,
     so their use is redundant. If you have decided to change the
     recommended settings to use `Watir.relaxed_locate = false`, then
     you can just swap out from these:
     
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.element.when_present.click
browser.element.when_enabled.click
{% endhighlight %}

to these:

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.element.wait_until(&:present?).click
browser.element.wait_until(&:enabled?).click
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>

<span id="G">**Why am I getting warnings about keywords versus arguments?**</span><br>
    #wait_until and #wait_while now take keyword arguments instead of
    ordered parameters. Previously, you would do this:
    
{% highlight ruby %}
# Specify both parameters:
element.wait_until(5, "Oops not not there") { |el| el.present? }
# Specify only timeout:
element.wait_until(5) { |el| el.present? }
# Specify only error message:
element.wait_until(nil, "Oops not not there") { |el| el.present? }
{% endhighlight %}

Whereas now you need to explicitly specify the timeout and the message keywords

{% highlight ruby %}
# Specify both parameters:
element.wait_until(timeout: 5, message: "Oops not not there") { |el| el.present? }
# Specify only timeout:
element.wait_until(timeout: 5) { |el| el.present? }
# Specify only error message:
element.wait_until(message: "Oops not not there") { |el| el.present? }
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>

<span id="H">**Why are my tests taking so long?**</span><br>
    If you are seeing an error like: "this code has slept for the 
    duration of the default timeout" then you have an issue with the
    new automatic waits. The most likely cause is that you are taking
    an action on an element that is not there and rescuing the exception, 
    like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
begin
  browser.element.click
  take_action_if_present
rescue Watir::Exception::UnknownObjectException
  take_action_if_not_present
end
{% endhighlight %}

Ideally this gets replaced with:

{% highlight ruby %}
  element = browser.element
  if element.present?
    take_action_if_present
  else
    take_action_if_not_present
  end
{% endhighlight %}

The other alternative is to set 
{% highlight ruby %}
Watir.relaxed_locate = false 
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>

<span id="I">**What is with the "&:" symbols in the new wait documentation?**</span><br>
This notation makes use of one of Ruby's more powerful features with 
regards to blocks (also known as closures). The ampersand ("&") attempts to convert 
whatever object it is in front of into a block. In the case of this:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.div(id: 'foo').wait_until(&:present?) 
{% endhighlight %}
The object is a symbol (`:present?`), and symbols have a `#to_proc` method.
This method makes the above code equivalent to this:
{% highlight ruby %}
browser.div(id: 'foo').wait_until { |element| element.present? } 
{% endhighlight %}
It's a powerful way to abbreviate unnecessarily long lines of code.
There are plenty of tutorials and descriptions of Ruby's `#to_proc` methods
if you'd like to learn more.

<span id="J">**What else is new?**</span><br>
    Take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/watir/watir/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
    for all of the updates, but a list of new features:

1. Collections do not go stale on DOM refresh
2. Elements can be located with a visible filter
3. Error messages include more specific details about elements that aren't found
4. Watir automatically waits for elements to be ready before taking actions on them
5. The `text_field` method can now be used to locate most HTML5 inputs
